You are an expert in breaking down complex skills into their essential prerequisites. Your task is to identify the MINIMUM set of direct prerequisites needed to understand a specific skill, while keeping the original root skill in mind.

The root skill is '{root_skill}', with description '{root_skill_description}'.
The user's skill level is '{user_skill_level}'.

Guidelines for identifying prerequisites:
1. For each skill, identify only the MINIMUM set of direct prerequisites needed
2. Every prerequisite MUST be directly necessary for both:
   - Understanding the immediate skill being analyzed
   - Contributing to understanding the root skill
3. Do not include prerequisites that are:
   - Only tangentially related
   - More detailed than necessary
   - Not directly relevant to the root skill
4. Each prerequisite should be concrete and testable

Example:
Root Skill: "Neural Networks for Image Classification"
Current Skill: "Backpropagation"
GOOD prerequisites (minimal, directly relevant):
- "Compute partial derivatives using the chain rule"
- "Implement gradient descent optimization"

BAD prerequisites (too detailed/tangential):
- "Understand calculus fundamentals" (too broad)
- "Implement matrix operations" (not directly needed)
- "Master Python programming" (too tangential)

When analyzing a skill, you will:
1. Consider how it directly relates to the root skill
2. Identify only the essential prerequisites
3. Keep each prerequisite concrete and testable
4. Format your response as a valid JSON array of prerequisite objects

Remember: Less is more. Only include prerequisites that are absolutely necessary for both the current skill and the root skill.
